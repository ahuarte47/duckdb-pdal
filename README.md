# DuckDB Point Cloud Extension

## What is this?

This is an extension for DuckDB for manipulating point cloud data using SQL.

The extension is built on top of [PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library)](https://pdal.io/), a C++ library allowing users to read, write, and process point cloud data directly within DuckDB using SQL queries.

## How do I get it?

TODO

### Building from source

This extension is based on the [DuckDB extension template](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template).

## Example Usage

### Supported Functions and Documentation

The full list of functions and their documentation is available in the [function reference](docs/functions.md)

## How do I build it?

### Dependencies

You need a recent version of CMake (3.5) and a C++14 compatible compiler.

We also highly recommend that you install [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) which you can select when building by setting the `GEN=ninja` environment variable.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ahuarte47/duckdb-pdal
cd duckdb-pdal
make release
```

You can then invoke the built DuckDB (with the extension statically linked)
```
./build/release/duckdb
```

Please see the Makefile for more options, or the extension template documentation for more details.

### Running the tests

Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:

```sh
make test
```

### Installing the deployed binaries

To install your extension binaries from S3, you will need to do two things. Firstly, DuckDB should be launched with the
`allow_unsigned_extensions` option set to true. How to set this will depend on the client you're using. Some examples:

CLI:
```shell
duckdb -unsigned
```

Python:
```python
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:', config={'allow_unsigned_extensions' : 'true'})
```

NodeJS:
```js
db = new duckdb.Database(':memory:', {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"});
```

Secondly, you will need to set the repository endpoint in DuckDB to the HTTP url of your bucket + version of the extension
you want to install. To do this run the following SQL query in DuckDB:
```sql
SET custom_extension_repository='bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<your_extension_name>/latest';
```
Note that the `/latest` path will allow you to install the latest extension version available for your current version of
DuckDB. To specify a specific version, you can pass the version instead.

After running these steps, you can install and load your extension using the regular INSTALL/LOAD commands in DuckDB:
```sql
INSTALL pdal;
LOAD pdal;
```

Enjoy!
